## Container
- [[docker]], [[kubernetes]]
- [LXC](https://github.com/lxc/lxc) is the well-known and heavily tested low-level Linux container runtime. It is in active development since 2008 and has proven itself in critical production environments world-wide. Some of its core contributors are the same people that helped to implement various well-known containerization features inside the Linux kernel.

- [Nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad) is an easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator that can deploy a mix of microservice, batch, containerized, and non-containerized applications. Nomad is easy to operate and scale and has native Consul and Vault integrations. https://www.nomadproject.io/



## [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI)
In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.
- [jenkinsci/jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins), In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server. Built with Java, it provides over 1600 plugins to support automating virtually anything, so that humans can actually spend their time doing things machines cannot.
- [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci), Free continuous integration platform for GitHub projects. https://travis-ci.org
  - Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration and deployment system. You can now test and deploy open source and private projects on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/)! You can read more about this change [here](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps).
