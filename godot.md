[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all sorts of projects. 
You can use it to create games or applications you can then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.
You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.
