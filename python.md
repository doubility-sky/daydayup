## Implementation
- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.
- [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on [Pyrex](https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/)). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
- [PyPy](https://github.com/pypy/pypy) is a replacement for CPython. It is built using the RPython language that was co-developed with it. The main reason to use it instead of CPython is speed: it runs generally faster (see next section).
- [Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran) is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific computing.
- [Codon](https://github.com/exaloop/codon) is a high-performance Python implementation that compiles to native machine code without any runtime overhead. 
- [Nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) is a Python compiler written in Python. It's fully compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4-3.13. You feed it your Python app, it does a lot of clever things, and spits out an executable or extension module.

### [Web Frameworks for Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks)
- [Django](https://github.com/django/django) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado) is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user. 
  - [Introduction to Tornado](https://docs.hacknode.org/itt2zh/)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/) and [Jinja](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.
