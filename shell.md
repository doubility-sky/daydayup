In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) is a command-line interpreter which exposes access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) or [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax), and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_shell)).

## [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) (sh)
The Bourne shell was the default shell for [Version 7 Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix). [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems continue to have /bin/sh—which will be the Bourne shell, or a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) or [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) to a compatible shell—even when other shells are used by most users.

### [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (the Bourne-Again shell)
Bash is a Unix [[shell]] and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and all releases of Apple's macOS prior to macOS Catalina. A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.

### [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

- [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) is to vim.

## [Terminal multiplexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)

### [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.

- [linux screen 命令详解](http://www.cnblogs.com/mchina/archive/2013/01/30/2880680.html)  
- Frequently Command:
  ```
  screen -ls             列出当前所有的session
         -r <作业名称>    恢复离线的screen作业。
  ```
- In Session Command:
  ```
  C-a n -> Next，切换到下一个 window 
  C-a p -> Previous，切换到前一个 window 
  C-a d -> detach，暂时离开当前session，
          将目前的 screen session (可能含有多个 windows) 丢到后台执行，
          并会回到还没进 screen 时的状态，此时在 screen session 里，
          每个 window 内运行的 process (无论是前台/后台)都在继续执行，即使 logout 也不影响。 
  ```

### [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) 
[tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.
