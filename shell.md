In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) is a command-line interpreter which exposes access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) or [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax), and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_shell)).

  echo $n    # 传递给脚本或函数的参数。n 是一个数字，表示第几个参数。例如，第一个参数是 $1 。
  echo $#    # 传递给脚本或函数的参数个数。
  echo $*    # 传递给脚本或函数的所有参数。
  echo $@    # 传递给脚本或函数的所有参数。被双引号 (" ") 包含时，与 $* 不同，下面将会讲到。
  echo $?    # 上个命令的退出状态，或函数的返回值。
  echo $$    # 当前 Shell 进程 ID。对于 Shell 脚本，就是这些脚本所在的进程 ID。
  echo $_    # 上一个命令的最后一个参数
  echo $!    # 后台运行的最后一个进程的 ID 号

## [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) (sh)
The Bourne shell was the default shell for [Version 7 Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix). [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems continue to have /bin/sh—which will be the Bourne shell, or a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) or [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) to a compatible shell—even when other shells are used by most users.

### [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (the Bourne-Again shell)
Bash is a Unix [[shell]] and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and all releases of Apple's macOS prior to macOS Catalina. A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.

### [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

- [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) is to vim.
