An [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.


- Common OS: [[BSD]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Windows]]
- [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/) is a website dedicated to talking about, reviewing and keeping up to date with [open source](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#opensource) [operating systems](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#os). This site particularly focuses on [Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#linux) [distributions](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#distribution) and flavours of [BSD](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=glossary#bsd), though other open source operating systems are sometimes discussed. There is a lot of information out there on Linux distributions and this site tries to collect and present that information in a consistent manner to make it easier to locate.



## Learn
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), a free online operating systems book! The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. 
- [The little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/): This text is a practical guide to writing your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help with the technical details while at the same time not reveal too much with samples and code excerpts.

## Unix
- [The UNIX Time-Sharing System](https://chsasank.github.io/classic_papers/unix-time-sharing-system.html)
- [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C. http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/
- [Awesome UNIX®](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-UNIX): This list is an exploration of the world of UNIX®, including UNIX history, the relevance of UNIX today, and lists select awesome UNIX and UNIX-like projects. This list also contains resources for UNIX standards, programming, communities, and free software. This project is not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by The Open Group.



## Projects
- [osdev](https://github.com/cstack/osdev) Following the tutorial: https://littleosbook.github.io
- [swieros](https://github.com/rswier/swieros): A tiny hand crafted CPU emulator, C compiler, and Operating System



## Resources
- [Awesome Operating System Stuff](https://github.com/jubalh/awesome-os): This list contains awesome OS related stuff. It contains open source operating sytems and hobby operating systems as one can study their code and learn from them.
- [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page): This website provides information about the creation of operating systems and serves as a community for those people interested in OS development with 655 wiki articles.
