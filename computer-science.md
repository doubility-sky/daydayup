[Computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) (sometimes called computation science) is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies the theory of computation and the practice of designing software systems.  

Fields of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics). Theoretical computer science includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "P = NP?" problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems.[69] Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.

- [learn](https://github.com/gyuho/learn), The best way to learn is to teach what you have learned to other people. I tried YouTube channel, which was hard to maintain. So I decided to write my own textbook. I am still learning, and I may say things out of ignorance. Every post is working in progress, non-committal on a timeline. The point is to review and improve over time. This is a personal white-board where I scribble anything, organize my code, learning experiences.

### courses
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - [计算机教育中缺失的一课](https://missing-semester-cn.github.io/): Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!
