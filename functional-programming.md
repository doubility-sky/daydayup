In computer science, [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.
