## FAQ
- [W3FOOLS](https://www.w3fools.com) - [为什么不推荐 W3Schools](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22332152)
  - When W3Fools was launched in 2011, the state of documentation for developers was poor. This site [documented many content errors and issues](https://web.archive.org/web/20110412103745/http://w3fools.com) with the W3Schools website. The [Mozilla Developer Network](http://developer.mozilla.org/) was around but it did not have much support at the time. 
  - Today, W3Schools has largely resolved these issues and addressed the majority of the undersigned developers' concerns. For many beginners, W3Schools has structured tutorials and playgrounds that offer a decent learning experience. Do keep in mind: a more complete education will certainly include MDN and other reputable resources.
